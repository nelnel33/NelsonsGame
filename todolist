Things to Implement — To Do List
	1.	Make MapGates that have a level/file path contain the level/file that it is connecting to rather than just having the path. Basically, save the level that is being contained directly into the main level
	-	Or have connecting MapGates be in the directory as the one that links to it, in order for it to connect.
	2.	Rework collision detection
	⁃	Hitbox Class	
	⁃	Make some sort of buffer range so objects can jump over a detection line.
	⁃	ActionPanel Class
	⁃	Works fine when touching the wall and moving up and down. But you get stuck when touching the wall and moving left and right.

	3.	Implement images/graphics directly into all entities
	⁃	There will be a default icon implemented by me
	⁃	But there will also be an option in the level editor to change the icon
	4.	Move character methods and logic into their own classes. i.e) npcMove and canNpcMove into NonPlayerCharacter Class or canMoveUp into Character Class
	5.	Rework access modifiers. 
	⁃	STOP USING protected
	⁃	Change so classes start using private modifiers
	6.	Reorganize classes 
	⁃	i.e. Entity classes are not in same package as GUI classes
	7.	Reorganize components of LevelEditor
	⁃	If you cannot import your own image, making specific tiles instead of generic tile. 
	⁃	i.e. instead of Entity, you have: grass, carpet, pavement.
	8.	Make it so when an NPC/Player is hit, it flashes a different color to show that damage has been taken.
	-	Could also show damage dealt on hit(damage dealt on NPC/Player by flashing it on sprite/icon).
	9.	Make portals auto connect
	-	Have a boolean variable that toggles on/off everytime you place a portal.
			-When its false it sets a main portal & holds it in a temporary placeholder.
			-When its true it sets a subportal and auto connects to the previous main portal
