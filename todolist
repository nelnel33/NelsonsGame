Things to Implement — To Do List
	1.	Make MapGates that have a level/file path contain the level/file that it is connecting to rather than just having the path. Basically, save the level that is being contained directly into the main level
	2.	Implement images/graphics directly into all entities
	⁃	There will be a default icon implemented by me
	⁃	But there will also be an option in the level editor to change the icon
	3.	Rework collision detection
	⁃	Hitbox Class	
	⁃	Change isAbove, isBelow, isLeft, isRight methods and all other methods that depend on it
	⁃	Use the Hitbox Class from GameTools then reimplement logic in ActionPanel
	⁃	ActionPanel Class
	⁃	Works fine when touching the wall and moving up and down. But you get stuck when touching the wall and moving left and right.
	4.	Move character methods and logic into their own classes. i.e) npcMove and canNpcMove into NonPlayerCharacter Class or canMoveUp into Character Class
	5.	Rework access modifiers. 
	⁃	STOP USING protected
	⁃	Change so classes start using private modifiers
	6.	Reorganize classes 
	⁃	i.e. Entity classes are not in same package as GUI classes
	7.	Reorganize components of LevelEditor
	⁃	If you cannot import your own image, making specific tiles instead of generic tile. 
	⁃	i.e. instead of Entity, you have: grass, carpet, pavement.
	8.	Make it so when an NPC/Player is hit, it flashes a different color to show that damage has been taken.
	-	Could also show damage dealt on hit(damage dealt on NPC/Player by flashing it on sprite/icon).
